- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Routing**: React Router DOM

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Firebase project with Auth and Firestore enabled

### Installation

1. Navigate to the admin directory:

   ```bash
   cd admin
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## User Roles and Permissions

### Super Administrator

- Full system access including invite management
- Can create invites for any role (including super admin)
- Can manage all users and invitations
- Analytics and settings access
- User management capabilities

### Support Staff

## Firebase Setup

The admin app uses the same Firebase configuration as the main Flutter app. Make sure your Firebase project has:

1. **Authentication** enabled with:

   - Email/Password provider
   - Google provider

2. **Firestore Database** with collections:
   - `admins` - Admin and support staff profiles
   - `invite_tokens` - Invitation tokens for secure registration
   - Other collections as needed for app functionality

## Security Rules

Ensure your Firestore security rules properly restrict access to admin collections:

```javascript
// Example security rule for admins collection
match /admins/{adminId} {
  allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
    request.auth.uid == resource.data.uid;
  allow read: if request.auth != null; // Allow reading for email verification
}
```

## Usage

### Creating Admin Accounts

**Step 1: First User Becomes Super Admin**

The **first person to sign up** automatically becomes the **Super Administrator** with full permissions:

1. Navigate to `/signup`
2. Fill in the registration form (no invitation needed for first user):
   - Full Name
   - Email Address
   - Password
   - Confirm Password
3. Submit to create your Super Admin account

**Step 2: Subsequent Users Need Invitations**

After the first user, all new admins must be invited:

1. Super admin or admin logs in and goes to `/invites`
2. Creates an invitation for the new team member (specify role and department)
3. New user receives invite link: `/signup?invite=TOKEN`
4. New user signs up using the invitation token
5. System automatically assigns the role specified in the invitation

⚠️ **Security**: After the first user signs up, the signup page requires valid invitation tokens.

### Signing In

1. Navigate to `/signin`
2. Use email/password or Google OAuth
3. Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the dashboard

### Dashboard Features

- Overview statistics
- Quick action buttons
- User profile management
- Role-based feature access

2. Add routes in `src/App.jsx`
3. Implement services in `src/services/`
4. Use the `useAuth` hook for authentication state

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment.

## Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Use TypeScript-style prop validation where applicable
3. Maintain consistent styling with the Onest font and color scheme
4. Test authentication flows thoroughly
